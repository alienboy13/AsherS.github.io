            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>I think that my mother was the start of this recipe. She taught 
                me how to make tuna salad (she used salmon, that's nurture, 
                not nature), and I went, "Hey, what if I made this taste like 
                something that isn't mustard?" So, I had lunches that were 
                almost exclusively "Tuna Salad" for about a month, and since I 
                had already removed the spice from life, I eventually decided 
                to put taco sauce in my "Tuna Salad" to compensate.</p>

            <p>Some "scholars" compare this to a dish called "Herring Under a 
                Fur Coat" that is apparently Russian in origin. Unfortunately, 
                mine doesn't use potatoes or eggs, and instead replaces them 
                with taco sauce. Not exactly true to the source material but 
                I'll take any opportunity to have people stop reacting to the 
                appearance of "Tuna Salad" by gaining the sudden overwhelming 
                urge to destroy it.

        <div class="prep-steps">
            <h2>Prep</h2>
            <p><strong>1.</strong> Get one full cup of rice (as per the measurement cup in the 
                rice cooker that was in Asher's apartment in late 2023) and 
                rinse it with a colander before you place it in the rice cooker 
                that was in Asher's apartment in late 2023. Then, fill it up to 
                the line with water. If you're using the rice cooker that was in 
                Asher's apartment in 2023, be sure to place it in a bowl of 
                water so that it doesn't overflow. That's important. 
                Start the rice cooker cooking.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you don't have the rice cooker that was in Asher's apartment 
                in 2023, just make a cup of rice
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>2.</strong> Chop a cup of white onion, and rinse a cup 
                of sugar snap peas and a cup of carrots. Good job, you're eating 
                your vegetables. Also chop up half of a roasted garlic summer 
                sausage. How much is this in volume you ask? I don't care, the 
                more the better.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>3.</strong> Prepare the liquids and seasonings used 
                later. Combine 1/3 a cup of General Tso's sauce, a tablespoon of 
                turmeric, and a teaspoon of Old Bay.

        <div class="cooking-time">
            <h2>Cooking Time!!!</h2>
            <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> The rice will be done at some point. 
                I know, very scary. You can let it warm if it's in a rice cooker 
                that auto warms (such as the rice cooker in Asher's apartment in 
                late 2023), but if not you have to deal with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1. </strong> Add a tablespoon of olive oil to the pan, 
                let it heat, and begin sautéing the vegetables. They normally 
                take about seven minutes. I've been told not to cook like a 
                scientist, so just go until you think that they're almost there.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>2. </strong> Next, add the sliced roasted garlic summer 
                sausage. You should attempt to brown this for about two more 
                minutes, really watching the vegetables more than the meat. 
                If you can, press the sausage into the pan to attempt to brown 
                it more on the edges. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>3. </strong> Now, add the liquid mixture that I like to 
                call "Asher's Stirfry sauce". It's sort of like Asher's 
                constant (1240 ev), but it's way cooler. Cook this for a couple 
                more minutes, and then you can pour out into a mixing bowl. 
                <p>(Preferably somewhere where you don't delaminate a table.)</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>4. </strong>Pour the rice over the stirfry in the mixing 
                bowl, and then mix them together with a mixing spoon, possibly 
                the same one as used to stir in the stirfry.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>5. </strong> Enjoy! This makes about two meals, so feel 
                free to share with a friend or enjoy leftovers.
