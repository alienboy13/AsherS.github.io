            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>I think that my mother was the start of this recipe. She taught 
                me how to make tuna salad (she used salmon, that's nurture, 
                not nature), and I went, "Hey, what if I made this taste like 
                something that isn't mustard?" So, I had lunches that were 
                almost exclusively "Tuna Salad" for about a month, and since I 
                had already removed the spice from life, I eventually decided 
                to put taco sauce in my "Tuna Salad" to compensate.</p>

            <p>Some "scholars" compare this to a dish called "Herring Under a 
                Fur Coat" that is apparently Russian in origin. Unfortunately, 
                mine doesn't use potatoes or eggs, and instead replaces them 
                with taco sauce. Not exactly true to the source material but 
                I'll take any opportunity to have people stop reacting to the 
                appearance of "Tuna Salad" by gaining the sudden overwhelming 
                urge to destroy it.
            </p>
        </div>
        

        <div class="prep-steps">
            <h2>Prep</h2>
            <p><strong>1.</strong> Drain and place the salmon in the bowl. 
                Break it up with a fork so it's at the bottom, especially if 
                you're using four cans. If you're using four cans you're 
                sacrificing taste for supply, but due to expiration times you'd 
                have to eat it every day for a couple meals a day to fit it in 
                a week. If so, Godspeed.

            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>2.</strong> Slice up the pickles, first longways in 
                half, then take a half, cut it in half, and then while you're 
                holding it down, cut it crossways into tinier pieces. Repeat for 
                each pickle, and move to side with knife.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>3.</strong> Slice 3-4 cross-sections out of the onion, 
                cut each like a pizza into triangles, but with really thin 
                slices so the section of the furthest out ring is only about the 
                length of the top joint of the thumb. Don't ask questions, just 
                follow the instructions. If you want to cut them differently, I 
                have no way to stop you, but that’s how it was done originally.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>4.</strong> Now, put the mayonnaise in the bowl, mix it 
                into the salmon until it looks like it's just kind of too much. 
                Don't worry, it is too much, but the other ingredients will fix 
                that. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>5.</strong> Now, add the mustard and taco sauce right 
                after another. Add to balance the mayonnaise, it should be 
                slightly pinkish once you're done evenly mixing it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>6.</strong> Evenly mix in the pickles and the onions. 
                Make sure that there's not any clumps, because that makes it 
                more difficult to make sandwiches, and especially difficult to 
                eat it with crackers.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>7.</strong> At this point, I'd usually slap it on a 
                sandwich with toasted bread and lettuce (because all my recipes 
                end up as a sandwich, a soup, or a salad) If not, crackers!
