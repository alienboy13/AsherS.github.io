            <p>Roasted Garlic Summer Stir-fry is a creation inspired by the 
                delicious taste of Roasted Garlic Summer Sausage, which is good 
                for the soul and all that. If you want to learn more about 
                Roasted Garlic Summer Sausage, you can watch the video at the

            <p>Anyways, the recipe is simple, and it involves two main 
                actions, one is preparing the rice, and the other is mixing and 
                cooking the Stirfry. These tasks are done in parallel, so the 
                recipe can be seen as follows:</p>
        </div>
        

        <div class="prep-steps">
            <h2>Prep</h2>
            <p><strong>1.</strong> Get one full cup of rice (as per the measurement cup in the 
                rice cooker that was in Asher's apartment in late 2023) and 
                rinse it with a colander before you place it in the rice cooker 
                that was in Asher's apartment in late 2023. Then, fill it up to 
                the line with water. If you're using the rice cooker that was in 
                Asher's apartment in 2023, be sure to place it in a bowl of 
                water so that it doesn't overflow. That's important. 
                Start the rice cooker cooking.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you don't have the rice cooker that was in Asher's apartment 
                in 2023, just make a cup of rice
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>2.</strong> Chop a cup of white onion, and rinse a cup 
                of sugar snap peas and a cup of carrots. Good job, you're eating 
                your vegetables. Also chop up half of a roasted garlic summer 
                sausage. How much is this in volume you ask? I don't care, the 
                more the better.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>3.</strong> Prepare the liquids and seasonings used 
                later. Combine 1/3 a cup of General Tso's sauce, a tablespoon of 
                turmeric, and a teaspoon of Old Bay.

        <div class="cooking-time">
            <h2>Cooking Time!!!</h2>
            <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> The rice will be done at some point. 
                I know, very scary. You can let it warm if it's in a rice cooker 
                that auto warms (such as the rice cooker in Asher's apartment in 
                late 2023), but if not you have to deal with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1. </strong> Add a tablespoon of olive oil to the pan, 
                let it heat, and begin sautéing the vegetables. They normally 
                take about seven minutes. I've been told not to cook like a 
                scientist, so just go until you think that they're almost there.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>2. </strong> Next, add the sliced roasted garlic summer 
                sausage. You should attempt to brown this for about two more 
                minutes, really watching the vegetables more than the meat. 
                If you can, press the sausage into the pan to attempt to brown 
                it more on the edges. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>3. </strong> Now, add the liquid mixture that I like to 
                call "Asher's Stirfry sauce". It's sort of like Asher's 
                constant (1240 ev), but it's way cooler. Cook this for a couple 
                more minutes, and then you can pour out into a mixing bowl. 
                <p>(Preferably somewhere where you don't delaminate a table.)</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>4. </strong>Pour the rice over the stirfry in the mixing 
                bowl, and then mix them together with a mixing spoon, possibly 
                the same one as used to stir in the stirfry.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>5. </strong> Enjoy! This makes about two meals, so feel 
                free to share with a friend or enjoy leftovers.
