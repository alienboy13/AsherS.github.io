            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>In the original edition of this cookbook, the text here was just 
                an explitive telling you to be serious about the lye. However,
                I do want to be slightly more professional here. So, just keep 
                in mind that these pretzels are delicious, but require a focused
                mind. Perhaps attempt meditation beforehand, and avoid watching 
                youtube videos on you phone while making this. It's not worth
                it.
            </p>
            <p>Here's a picture of how the space might look for lye protection

        </div>
        

        <div class="prep-steps">
            <h2>Prep</h2>
            <p><strong>1.</strong> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees, line a few 
                baking sheets you have with parchment paper. Once your gloves 
                have lye on them you want the transfer to be easy! Just a 
                reminder that we're not messing around
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>2.</strong> Add the yeast (1tbsp/1pkt), the brown sugar 
                (1tbsp), and 1/4 cup of water. Whisk and let sit for 5 minutes 
                or until it begins frothing.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>3.</strong> Add the remaining water(1 1/4 cups), the 
                flour (5 cups) the salt (3/4 tsp) and really get in there with 
                your hands and knead it for about ten minutes. If the dough 
                doesn't form, just add more flour. I'm not a purist on dough, 
                just on not suffering lye burns
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>4.</strong> Fun fact, this dough doesn't need to rise. 
                Bet you're glad you started preheating the oven earlier, eh?
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>5.</strong> Transfer the dough to a non-floured work 
                surface (Another twist!), and divide it into ten equal pieces. 
                This can be done by eye or by rolling it into a sheet and then 
                cutting with kitchen shears. 
            </p>
            <p>
                
                
                    <strong>6.</strong> 5.Roll the remaining dough into round about 
                    24 inch logs.
                    <ul>
                        <!-- Sub-bullets for the 1/2 cup of food grade lye -->
                        <li><span>This is where things get interesting, as you 
                            have many paths before you. No matter what you 
                            choose, the recipe continues the same way. I'll 
                            recommend my two favorites.</span>
                            <!-- now we add one space here-->

                        </li>

                        <li> <strong>Path #1</strong>: Shape the pretzels traditionally, i.e : 
                            Shape the log into a letter U. Cross the arms 
                            placing one over the other then twist them around 
                            each other once. Bring the ends down to the bottom 
                            of the U and gently press to stick. Place on greased 
                            parchment lined baking sheets.

                        </li>
                        <li> <strong>Path #2</strong>: Cut each rope crosswise into eleven (or 
                            whatever makes sense) pieces, and then roll them 
                            into nugget esque shapes to make pretzel nuggets. 
                            Place on greased parchment lined baking sheets.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                

            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>7.</strong> At this point, I'd usually slap it on a 
                sandwich with toasted bread and lettuce (because all my recipes 
                end up as a sandwich, a soup, or a salad) If not, crackers!

            <h2>The Part Where You Can Damage Yourself And Your Belongings Beyond Repair</h2>
            <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Hi, it's me again. This is another 
                quick reminder to be careful. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1. </strong> Place a thick towel on a surface with 
                plenty of room, place a large stainless steel pot well into the 
                sheet. On one side place your baking sheets that contain the 
                pretzel dough and then lay down parchment paper equal to the 
                dimensions of your baking sheets as close as you can to the pot. 
                Prepare a cup of vinegar nearby in case of emergency. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>2. </strong> Add Ten cups of water carefully into the 
                pot, and prepare an area nearby for any utensils you will use in 
                this process. Since you're not from the future I'll tell you to 
                get a pair of silicone tongs and a silicone spatula.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>3. </strong> Apply your nitrile gloves and goggles. 
                Check to make sure all of your skin below your neck is 
                covered</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>4. </strong>Grab your <span class="red-text"><span></span>PLASTIC</span> measuring cup and 
                carefully pour a half cup of lye above the pot. Don't worry if 
                it's slightly under, less lye is better than <span class="red-text"><span></span>burning yourself
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>5. </strong> <span class="red-text"><span></span>
                Carefully pour the lye into the pot, potential splashes will 
                harm you!</span> Use a silicone spatula to sir the lye to 
                dissolve, it is dissolved when it appears clear.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>6. </strong> Use the 
                tongs to carefully dip each of the pretzels in the lye, and hold 
                it under for 30 seconds. Afterwards, hold it slightly above the 
                bath for fifteen more seconds to let it drip off any excess lye. 
                <span class="red-text"><span></span>Remember not to put the tongs anywhere but on parchment paper 
                as this will cause them to damage your surface.</span> Then, transfer 
                your pretzels to the clean baking sheet covered with greased 
                parchment paper.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>7. </strong> Once you are done, clear the sink, and 
                carefully pour the mixture down the drain. You may pour part of 
                the cup of vinegar down afterwards if you wish, but keep some 
                around just in case.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>8. </strong> Whisk an egg in a bowl, and use a brush to 
                apply the egg bath to the pretzels. Then, pour salt or other 
                desired flavorings over them.
