            <h2>Description:</h2>

            <p>
                This recipe is dedicated to a friend of mine named Ben. He once 
                sent me a meatloaf recipe that used a box of stuffing as an 
                ingredient, and as a college student I began to consider the 
                concept of cheap and easy meals. To this point, the recipe book 
                has been structured for price efficiency, but I believe that it 
                also requires a rating based on ease of preparation, as I will 
                be a full time college student/part-time Data 
                Scientist\part-time TA as the year continues on. 
                It doesn't matter that I left a robot corpse on his desk, 
                I still respect Ben greatly and it's strange that the only place 
                I may ever say or write that is in a meatloaf recipe.

        <div class="prep-steps">
            <h2>Prep</h2>
            <p><strong>1.</strong> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees, and grease 
                the meatloaf dish
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>2.</strong> Chop a cup of onion
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>3.</strong> Within a large mixing bowl, mix together dry 
                stuffing mix, the ground turkey, the eggs, the water, the onion, 
                and only half of the sauce of choice(ex: ketchup). Do not use 
                all the sauce on this step. Please.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>4.</strong> Place the fully prepared mix into the dish, 
                smooth it down evenly with your hands. Then cover it with the 
                remaining ketchup/sauce of choice.

            <p>
                <strong>1. </strong> Place the meatloaf in the oven for around 
                45-60 minutes at the preheated temperature of 350. Go and do 
                your homework.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>2. </strong> Remove from dish and enjoy! See attached

            </p>
            <p>
                Then go back to doing your homework, you college student.
